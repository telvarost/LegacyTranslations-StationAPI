# LegacyTranslations for Minecraft Beta 1.7.3

## This mod is not fully completed yet

### Addon Credits
* @Roadhog360 - Initially creating the Legacy Translation System for New Frontier Craft
* @Birevan - The foundation and inspiration for the creation of this addon, alongside the source of many of the internal textures and files that let it function
* @[NFC] Vivian -  Bugfixes, Documentation, & porting the Legacy Translation System to Vanilla

### Description
This mod adds custom language loading capabilities to the game. Rather than the hardcoded and static language list that Mojang's modern Minecraft provides the player, the Translation System has a custom language system much the same as texturepacks. This means that users can add their own languages and/or modify existing ones to their heart's content. Our hope is that this can eventually become the standard for community translations of these older versions of the game.

### Future Plans
Fabric and other variants without base class edits will be created in the future.
* (This repo is that fabric port)

### Notes
We've extended the available selection of valid characters in Beta to allow for more language translations beyond what was possible in Vanilla. Currently translations are limited to left-to-right character based languages, however future versions of the LT System will resolve this by adding Unicode support & right-to-left character support done by @icanttellyou

### Translations
Currently, no translations are built into the addon, as they all still need to receive ports to guarantee compatibility with the LT System. Translations will either need to be created yourself or re-used from New Frontier Craft. Be sure to get permission from the original language pack creators that created the NFC Translations before redistributing your updated versions of their work. Future versions of the LT System will bundle in a selection of language packs
